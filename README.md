## Data Sources:
* The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and is publicly accessible.
* The data was not fully clean. I was performed preprocessing for analysis.
* All dataset files are included within the project repository.

## Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using Linear Regression algorithm on the dataset. It achieves 86% accuracy on the test set.
